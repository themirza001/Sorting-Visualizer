# Sorting Visualizer with Sound Effects

A dynamic web-based sorting visualizer that showcases the functionality of different sorting algorithms, enhanced with interactive controls and audio feedback. Built using HTML, CSS, and advanced JavaScript, this project offers a visually and audibly engaging way to understand sorting algorithms.

## Features

- **Real-Time Visualization:** Supports multiple sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Selection Sort.
- **Interactive Controls:** Easily adjust array size, sorting speed, and algorithm selection from the user interface.
- **Sound Effects:** Each element swap is accompanied by a sound effect, adding an auditory dimension to the sorting process.
- **Responsive Controls:** Includes play, pause, and resume functionalities to control the animation of sorting.
- **Optimized Performance:** Efficient animations managed with `requestAnimationFrame` ensure smooth visual transitions.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the visualizer.
- **JavaScript:** For implementing the sorting algorithms and handling animations.
- **Audio API:** For generating sound effects corresponding to sorting actions.
